Work in progress. 

I'm practicing learning new skills in web development as a passion project for displaying a portfolio-like site that serves as a landing page for past and current endeavors (as well as familiarizing myself with github commands, and having fun!)

I'm excited that my website is up and running. 

It still needs a lot more content pushed onto it but I have a lot of ideas that include attaining analytics, developing user frameworks, and implementing machine learning behind the scenes to improve my website statistics. 

I aim to get more users to chime in on my site, give feedback, and iteratively move forward, exploring, reading, and inspire excitement to check out what is next! 

I am always working towards developing my data science, machine learning, AI and software skills. 

Thank you for checking this out.
